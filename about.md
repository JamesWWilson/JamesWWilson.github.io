Howdy! Welcome to my blog. 

My name is James Wilson ([@jwilson2032](https://twitter.com/jwilson2032)). I am currently an Associate for Ankura Consulting, where I focus on applying data science applications and methodologies to economic and litigation challenges. I graduated from UCLA in 2019 with a B.S. in Statistics & minor in Digital Humanities.

Previously, I was a Data Analytics Intern for ChowNow, where I worked on analyzing customer retention rates and automating our marketing email catalog for 1+ millions customers.

I have also worked in several other industries, helping provide analytics and research for ICANN, NBCUniversal, and Navigant Consulting.

This website serves to showcase several independent projects I have worked on in my spare time. I write about data science applications, statistical investigations, and other random musings I may have. See the details and code for my projects at my [Github repository](https://github.com/JamesWWilson). If you have any questions, reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-wesley-wilson/).

*Have fun, make friends, go Bruins.*
