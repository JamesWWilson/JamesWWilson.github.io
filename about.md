Howdy! Welcome to my blog. 

My name is James Wilson ([@jameswwilson_](https://twitter.com/jameswwilson_)). I am a Senior Data Scientist for Capgemini, where I focus on applying data science and data engineering methodologies to challenges that top companies face in today's data driven world. I graduated from UCLA in 2019 with a B.S. in Statistics & minor in Digital Humanities, and am currently pursuing a Masters in Computer Science through Georgia Tech's OMSCS program. 

This website serves to showcase independent projects and writings I develop in my spare time. I like to write about data science applications, statistical investigations, and other random musings and hobbies. See the details and code for my projects at my [Github repository](https://github.com/JamesWWilson). If you have any questions, reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-wesley-wilson/).

*Have fun, make friends, go Bruins.*
