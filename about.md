Howdy! Welcome to my blog. 

My name is James Wilson ([@jwilson2032](https://twitter.com/jwilson2032)). I am currently a Data Scientist - Senior Consultant for Capgemini, where I focus on applying data science and data engineering methodologies to challenges that top companies face in today's data driven world. I graduated from UCLA in 2019 with a B.S. in Statistics & minor in Digital Humanities, and I plan to return to graduate school (sometime!?) in the future. 

My previous experiences have included:
- DataStat Associate for Ankura Consulting 
    - Applied data engineering and statistical inference for economic and litigation challenges
- Data Analytics Intern for ChowNow
    - Analyzed customer retention rates and automaed our marketing email catalog for 1+ millions customers
- Analytics and research internships for ICANN, NBCUniversal, and Navigant Consulting

This website serves to showcase independent projects and writings I develop in my spare time. I like to write about data science applications, statistical investigations, and other random musings. See the details and code for my projects at my [Github repository](https://github.com/JamesWWilson). If you have any questions, reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-wesley-wilson/).

*Have fun, make friends, go Bruins.*
