I'm an Associate for Ankura Consulting, focusing on applying Data Science to litigation and economic problems. I graduated from UCLA in 2019 with a B.S. in Statistics & minor in Digital Humanities. 

Previously, I was a Data Analytics Intern for ChowNow, where I worked on analyzing customer retention rates and general data research. 

I have also spent time interning in other industries, helping provide analytics for ICANN, NBCUniversal, and Navgiant Consulting.
