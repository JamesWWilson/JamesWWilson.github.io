Howdy! Welcome to my blog. 

I am a Senior Data Scientist for the Max Platform @ Warner Brothers Discovery, where I focus on applying machine learning and data engineering to content and marketing strategy. My specialties as of late have been focused on propensity modeling, marketing-mix-modeling (MMM), and multi-touch attribution (MTA). I have 5+ years of prior experience in data science consulting and analytics with Fortune-500 companies, startups, and economic litigation firms, where I have used my background to help solve problems that top companies face in today's data driven world. 

I graduated from UCLA in 2019 with a B.S. in Statistics & minor in Digital Humanities. I am currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science through Georgia Tech's OMSCS program, specializaing in Machine Learning. 

This website serves to showcase independent projects and writings I develop in my spare time. I like to write about data science applications, statistical investigations, and my own musings and hobbies. See the details and code for my projects at my [Github repository](https://github.com/JamesWWilson). If you have any questions, please reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-wesley-wilson/).

*Have fun, make friends, go Bruins.*
