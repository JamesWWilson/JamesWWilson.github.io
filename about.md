Howdy! Welcome to my data science blog.

My name is James Wilson ([@jwilson2032](https://twitter.com/jwilson2032)). I am currently an Associate for Ankura Consulting, where I focus on applying Data Science to economic and litigation problems. I graduated from UCLA in 2019 with a B.S. in Statistics & minor in Digital Humanities.

Previously, I was a Data Analytics Intern for ChowNow, where I worked on analyzing customer retention rates and automating our marketing email catalog.

I have also worked in several other industries, helping provide analytics for ICANN, NBCUniversal, and Navigant Consulting.

This website serves to showcase several independent projects I have worked on in my spare time. See the details of my projects at my [Github repository](https://github.com/JamesWWilson).
